An apt rewording of the statement could be that people are never too old to learn. Learning is definitely a lifelong process. A structured environment could very well facilitate the flow of information. These require more discussion.Whatever, the influence, people are always picking up new ideas. This is advantageous for a number of reasons. Primarily, humans look for ways to make things easier, which affects our daily life positively, leaving time for other things like family and relaxation. So, regardless of how people acquire information, it still equals learning. Each time one drives a new way to work in order to save time, he is learning. Similarly, to get things we want, we sometimes have to go through structured programs to get more knowledge on a subject. This, perhaps, may help to get a promotion, receive a higher salary, or even start a new career. Quite a few institutions have recognized this and have planned curricula in response to growing need.The advent of the Internet and other outreach programs has caused an explosion in programs for nontraditional university students. Now, more schools than ever have special programs whereby a student may get a BA, MA, or a PhD without ever attending one class at the university. Our world have become so filled up with other responsibilities that we rarely have the opportunity to attend school, as people did fifty years ago. But diligent school administrators have provided us the luxury of attending school in the comfort of our own homes. The structure of the traditional classroom is not the only one available to meet our needs. The people who were for years looked at sideways for being thirty and returning to school have now supplanted the focus of programs tailored around wants and academic needs. New departments have sprung up, or old ones have taken on a new mission. Currently, they include telling names, such as lifelong learning, adult learners, nontraditional students, distance programs, lifelong education, and many others. The educational institutions are changing with the times.As technology changes to help us, we will change to better help ourselves. There really are an inordinate number of opportunities to get the education if one wants it badly enough. The population of nontraditional-age students has skyrocketed, so one should never fell out of place. Doing the work is simply a question of priority.
