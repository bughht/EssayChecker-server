During the past few decades, people either in developed countries or developing ones have witnessed a substantial growing of the international tourism; this, no double, brought happiness to the tourists and prosperity to the recipient countries. Nonetheless, in my view, the overall impact of the ever-growing international holiday-** would be considered negative. The reasons for this are manifold.In the first place, the influx of international tourists does not merely bring the host countries economical prosperity, but bring with them the harmful cultural defects. Such as prostitution as well as alcoholism and substance abuse, just to satisfy the needs of these holidaymakers. And all of these render originally peaceful and pure countries to be a place with crime and instability.In the second place, the international tourism also creates pollutions as well as cause damage to certain attractions. For one thing, the fossil fuel consumed during the journey and the pollutants left behind by the tourists possess grave threaten to the local environment and the ecosystem. A very salient example is the Great barrel reef in Australia. During the past few years, the visiting of countless boats, divers caused devastating damage to the coral live around the reef; the world renowned “Kuta” beach has also been polluted a lot by the tourists these years.Finally, the quick money provides by the international tourism renders the local people become snobbish. Children who are no more than 16 abandon their school to provide specific services to the tourists simply for earning some humble incomes. This phenomenon has been exacerbated during the past few years especially in the developing countries like Thailand and Indonesia.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the overall effect of the international tourist industry is bad. This condition would remain the same for a relatively long period of time and the government should take methods to curb the negative impacts that this would generate.
