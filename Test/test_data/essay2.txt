My personal answer to the purpose of education is that students and teaching staff should hold critical attitudes. It means that education involves the temporary and ultimate goals. The ultimate goal of education is the service of society. However, whether or not achieving it should take the accomplishment of personal goals as the prerequisite.On one hand, students are expecting to acquire the survival skills with the aid of schooling training in the professional skills and thinking abilities. Personal ambitions also consist of the access to their preferred working fields and the progression in the professional fields. Besides, they finally win the social respect and acknowledgement.When it comes to whether or not taking the social service to the society as the education goal,views differed greatly. However, I firmly believe that the accomplishment of personal wishes does not contradict to the willingness to the service of society. Graduates have to acquire the decent jobs, reasonable salary and social respect first and simultaneously contribute to the society. Take the excellent architects as an example, they design the fashionable structures for peopleâ€™s living and aesthetic demand while they can acquire adecent income as well.
