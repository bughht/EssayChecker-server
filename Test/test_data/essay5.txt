Nowadays, couples quarrel more often than they used to do. Brothers and sisters talk less and take less care of each other. Children turn less to their parents for advice. These scenes are just part of the whole picture of today's family alienation. As far as I am concerned, there are several reasons for these phenomena. The first reason is that people spend more time on their studies and work. Nowadays, people face fierce competition and suffer from great pressure. As a result, they have to devote more time and energy to their careers. Some people are too busy to spare time for their family. What is more, many jobs require people to work in other cities and many children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time passes, these people become emotionally estranged from their families.The alienation among families is also attributed to the increasing number of entertainments available.High technology brings modern people more interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games. Consequently, people are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting the feelings of their family members.Last but not least, people are now more independent than before. Apart from their family, they can easily get help from their friends and it is much easier to make more friends as a result of the rapid improvement in telecommunication. Therefore they are not as dependent on their families as before. To bring families closer, people put forward various suggestions. First, we should spare more time with our family members, no matter how occupied we are. Second, teach children the sense of family when they are still young. Last but not least, the government should organize activities to promote public awareness of the importance of a harmonious family relationship.
