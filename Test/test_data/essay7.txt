People call the city or the small town home for a wealth of reasons, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Primarily, the small-town people espouse familiarity. In contrast, the city dwellers hide amidst the anonymity. These statements require further scrutiny.In a small town or in the country, the citizens become acquainted rather quickly. This acquaintance has several subtopics to it. First, families become friends for many generations, and that has a profound impact on lives. The families sometimes intermarry. Consequently, if people do relocate, often they later return to their original home, because both sets of parents live there. Next, land is often involved. Therefore, a kinship is made to the area and not only the people. It is difficult to walk away from an inheritance involving land. Finally, people work together on community projects, bonding them together by the process of building something. If a new Wal-Mart comes to town, everyone feels the spirit of progress together. This stands in direct contrast to life in the city.The city has many attractive features that lure, just like the small town. The idea of not being readily recognized may appeal to some. With several million people in a metropolis and its surrounding areas, one could go for years and never run into an acquaintance. The probably usually have no desire to return someplace after they leave. There is nothing to keep them stationary. In addition, in that there is no kinship to land, city dwellers like the freedom of mobility. They could move every several months and always have something new. As the city consistently experiences growth, one may look for the best spot to live, replete with post office, and array of restaurants, diversity of culture, and any number of conveniences. The only link a city dweller has in a lot of cases to anything is his own desire to be free. Additional comments follow.The city and the small town have many benefits to consider. What is right to start out life could change as one gets older. People are lucky at times that they do not have to choose, at least not forever, but can move at will. Maybe this is why some richer people have homes both in the small town and in the city.
