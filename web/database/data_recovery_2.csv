"Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you (500 word limit).","A misplaced foot on the accelerator instead of the brakes made me the victim of someone's careless mistake. Rushing through the dark streets of my hometown in an ambulance, I attempted to hold back my tears while two supportive Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) comforted me. Although I suffered a minor knee injury, the trauma of that accident still lingers.
Fast forward six years to the present. Now I am sitting in the back of the ambulance, a rookie EMT, with my purple gloves on, stethoscope around my neck, and a red medical bag in hand. I am also making sure we have the proper medical equipment stocked, including neck collars and long body boards.
As I step out of the ambulance, a bitter breeze nips at my face. Shattered glass, two crushed car hoods, and traffic everywhere, the scene is put into perspective as I can finally see what is happening. I stop in my tracks. It is my accident all over again.
""Get the collars and boards, there is a possible back injury,"" my partner whispers to me. I fetch the items, still attempting to deal with my conflicting emotions. Using the help of five other EMTs, we extricate the victim from the car and secure him to the stretcher. While in the ambulance, I realize now that circumstances have been reversed. This time, clutching the patient's hand, I tried to soothe him, and he slowly calms down. I keep my composure and actively tried to help the patient feel as comfortable as I did. Keeping all of his personal belongings close to me, we wheel him into the busy emergency room and transfer him safely. As we leave, he looked into my eyes and I could feel his sincere gratitude. Rather than being an innocent victim, like the current patient was, I am now the rescuer.
Even though I felt the horrid memories rushing back, I kept my duties as a rescuer in the forefront of my mind. Keeping my cool in the face of extreme pressure I came out of the call a changed person: someone who can see a problem, regardless of any bias I may have, and focus only on what is happening at that instant. Confidently facing my own terrors, I felt as if conquering my fears allowed me to face my duties with a grounded and compassionate outlook.
Tears stream, limbs hurt, children cry: I am there, with a smile on my face, a stethoscope around my neck, compassion in my heart, happy to help and proud to serve.",90.0,"You have chosen a significant experience that demonstrates your personal growth and passion for helping others.

"Some people think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others, however, believe there are better alternative ways of reducing crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 251 words.","Crime is a serious and growing problem in most societies. Although many people believe that the best way to tackle this is to place people in prison for longer periods, others are of the opinion that other measures will be more effective.
There are benefits of giving offenders longer prison sentences. Firstly, spending a long time in prison provides an opportunity for the prison services to rehabilitate a prisoner. For example, someone who has committed a serious offence such as assault will need a long time in prison in order to be sure they can be re-educated not to re-offend. In addition to this, longer prison sentences will act as a deterrent for someone who is thinking of committing a crime.
However, some people argue that leaving people in prison for a long time means that they will mix with other criminals and so their character will not improve. One alternative is community service. This gives an offender the opportunity to give something positive back to society, and so it may improve their character. Also, the government could focus its resources on the causes of crime, which would lead to less crime in the future.
In my opinion, it is important to look at alternative methods. Many countries have lengthy prison sentences, but crime has continued to increase throughout the world, so it is clear that this is not completely effective. That said, long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder, as justice for the victim and their family should take priority.
To conclude, there are good arguments for and against long sentences, so governments must continue to research the various methods of crime reduction to ensure effective policies are in place.",80.0,"You have addressed the topic and the task well.

Governments should be responsible for funding and controlling scientific research rather than private organizations. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own experience or knowledge. Write at least 250 words.,"Undertaking scientific research is imperative if countries want to progress and compete in a globalized world. However, the funding and controlling of this research remain contentious issues. In my opinion, the government should have the predominant responsibility for these.
One of the first issues is the knowledge that we gain from research. If governments are responsible then they are driven by the need to make advances in knowledge in order to improve people鈥檚 lives. This is because they are accountable to the public and the research is paid for by taxes. On the other hand, private organizations are driven by profit. This may mean that some research that could be valuable to society may not begin because there is no monetary gain.
Another issue related to this is the research process. When the funding for research comes from the same organization that is going to gain from a favorable outcome, there is a strong potential for biased results. Taking drugs companies as an example, legislation usually requires rigorous trials for new drugs that can take many years to complete. The companies have large amounts of money invested in such research and the need for positive results is paramount. It is difficult for a scientist to remain impartial in these circumstances. However, if this is controlled and funded by governments, their accountability means that such conflicts of interest are less likely to occur.
On balance, I would argue that although it is not realistic to remove all opportunities for privately funded research, governments should have the main responsibility for the monitoring and controlling of this. Strong checks and balances need to be in place to ensure future research is ethical and productive.",85.0,"You have addressed the topic well and provided relevant examples and reasons to support your opinion.

Topic：Water resources around the world are falling deficient. Analyze the possible reasons and provide your suggestions.,"Access to water is vital to every living creature on the planet. Despite the fact that approximately two thirds of the earth surface is covered with all forms of water bodies, countries worldwide are faced with different levels of water shortages. Some reasons can be cited to explain the emergence of this problem.A trigger for water crisis is people’s lack of knowledge of the value of the water. Given the ready availability of water in many countries, people tend to believe that the reserve of water in the world is infinite. Notwithstanding the increased expenditure on water supply, water is perceived as a cheap commodity by many families. Many people see water a perpetual resource. For this reason, the unbridled use of water is commonplace, accelerating the exhaustion of this valuable resource.Rapid population growth is another force contributing to the water crisis. Not only does it reduce the amount of water available for manufacture, farming and households, but also has a profound effect on the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. Massive urban and industrial growth fuels unprecedented demands, often at the expense of aquatic ecosystems. Many water resources are not replenished before being re-used and depleted.Human-induced pollution is worthy of concern as well, a factor regarded by many as the root cause of the rapid loss of drinkable water. The untreated discharge of various pollutants such as heavy metals, organic toxins, oils and solids in water bodies is believed to have severe impacts. Industrialization, meanwhile, results in abnormal climate and biological destruction. While some areas have become barren, other areas are hit by floods. Floods ravage everything, including reservoirs, dams and cannel. The water supply problem will intensify.As noted above, the steady loss of water is attributable to inappropriate usage, population growth and pollution. In order to tackle the above-mentioned problems, one can adopts various approaches, besides the existing strategies, such as restoration of ecosystems, rainwater harvest. New technologies can help ease water shortages, by tackling pollution and making used water recyclable. In agriculture, water use can be made far more efficient by introducing new farming techniques (e.g. drip irrigation). Drought-resistant plants can help cut the amount of water needed.",75.0,"The essay discusses some of the possible reasons for the falling water resources around the world. It highlights the lack of knowledge of the value of water, population growth and human-induced pollution as the key factors behind the depletion of water resources.

Trying to save endangered animal species from extinction is a waste of valuable resources.Do you agree or disagree?,"The issue of whether we should attempt to save endangered species from extinction or not is certainly a contentious one. Despite the arguments of some people that such animals serve no useful purpose and should be allowed to die out just as many others (including the dinosaurs) have in the past, it is my personal belief that they should in fact be preserved. Two of the principal reasons for this are as follows.Firstly, it is vital that we appreciate the importance of endangered species in maintaining the balance of nature. Ecosystems are delicate arrangements where plants and animals all depend on each other for survival. The disappearance or introduction of any animal species disrupts the balance and negatively impacts upon other plants and animals by breaking the food chain and altering the habitat in which they live. Such imbalances frequently return to haunt us in unexpected ways. Just as rabbits that were introduced to Australia soon after European settlement now compete with native species for food and destroy farmers’ crops, the extinction of a predator can cause plagues by allowing its prey to multiply unchecked. Therefore, since ecological change constitutes a potential risk to us and our environment, it is clearly I our own interests to protect endangered species.Yet, perhaps the strongest argument in favor of preserving endangered species is that all life has intrinsic value; even if endangered species are not useful to us in any practical way they should be preserved nevertheless. Further, given that we humans are responsible for destroying the natural habitat of many endangered animals, we should make every possible effort to save them.In conclusion, I once again restate my view that saving endangered species is worthwhile. Not only do they help to maintain the balance of nature, but they also have value in and of themselves.",85.0,"The essay presents two compelling reasons for why endangered species should be preserved, namely to maintain the balance of nature and to uphold the intrinsic value of life. These reasons are supported with relevant examples and the writer makes clear that protecting endangered species is in our own interest. However, the essay could have been stronger if it included counterarguments to present a more balanced view of the issue.",90.0,The essay clearly states the writer's position on the issue and provides reasoning to support it.

"International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not.What are your opinions on this?","During the past few decades, people either in developed countries or developing ones have witnessed a substantial growing of the international tourism; this, no double, brought happiness to the tourists and prosperity to the recipient countries. Nonetheless, in my view, the overall impact of the ever-growing international holiday-** would be considered negative. The reasons for this are manifold.In the first place, the influx of international tourists does not merely bring the host countries economical prosperity, but bring with them the harmful cultural defects. Such as prostitution as well as alcoholism and substance abuse, just to satisfy the needs of these holidaymakers. And all of these render originally peaceful and pure countries to be a place with crime and instability.In the second place, the international tourism also creates pollutions as well as cause damage to certain attractions. For one thing, the fossil fuel consumed during the journey and the pollutants left behind by the tourists possess grave threaten to the local environment and the ecosystem. A very salient example is the Great barrel reef in Australia. During the past few years, the visiting of countless boats, divers caused devastating damage to the coral live around the reef; the world renowned “Kuta” beach has also been polluted a lot by the tourists these years.Finally, the quick money provides by the international tourism renders the local people become snobbish. Children who are no more than 16 abandon their school to provide specific services to the tourists simply for earning some humble incomes. This phenomenon has been exacerbated during the past few years especially in the developing countries like Thailand and Indonesia.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the overall effect of the international tourist industry is bad. This condition would remain the same for a relatively long period of time and the government should take methods to curb the negative impacts that this would generate.",85.0,"The essay provides a clear and substantial argument on the negative impact of international tourism.

It is generally acknowledged that the relationship among family members is now not as close as it used to be. Give possible reasons and your recommendations.,"Nowadays, couples quarrel more often than they used to do. Brothers and sisters talk less and take less care of each other. Children turn less to their parents for advice. These scenes are just part of the whole picture of today's family alienation. As far as I am concerned, there are several reasons for these phenomena. The first reason is that people spend more time on their studies and work. Nowadays, people face fierce competition and suffer from great pressure. As a result, they have to devote more time and energy to their careers. Some people are too busy to spare time for their family. What is more, many jobs require people to work in other cities and many children have to leave their parents at an early age to study or work elsewhere. As time passes, these people become emotionally estranged from their families.The alienation among families is also attributed to the increasing number of entertainments available.High technology brings modern people more interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games. Consequently, people are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting the feelings of their family members.Last but not least, people are now more independent than before. Apart from their family, they can easily get help from their friends and it is much easier to make more friends as a result of the rapid improvement in telecommunication. Therefore they are not as dependent on their families as before. To bring families closer, people put forward various suggestions. First, we should spare more time with our family members, no matter how occupied we are. Second, teach children the sense of family when they are still young. Last but not least, the government should organize activities to promote public awareness of the importance of a harmonious family relationship.",70.0,"The essay adequately addresses the reasons behind the increasing lack of closeness among family members, such as increased competition and work pressure, the availability of entertainment, and increased independence.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? One should not give up on getting a degree just because she is a little older. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,"An apt rewording of the statement could be that people are never too old to learn. Learning is definitely a lifelong process. A structured environment could very well facilitate the flow of information. These require more discussion.Whatever, the influence, people are always picking up new ideas. This is advantageous for a number of reasons. Primarily, humans look for ways to make things easier, which affects our daily life positively, leaving time for other things like family and relaxation. So, regardless of how people acquire information, it still equals learning. Each time one drives a new way to work in order to save time, he is learning. Similarly, to get things we want, we sometimes have to go through structured programs to get more knowledge on a subject. This, perhaps, may help to get a promotion, receive a higher salary, or even start a new career. Quite a few institutions have recognized this and have planned curricula in response to growing need.The advent of the Internet and other outreach programs has caused an explosion in programs for nontraditional university students. Now, more schools than ever have special programs whereby a student may get a BA, MA, or a PhD without ever attending one class at the university. Our world have become so filled up with other responsibilities that we rarely have the opportunity to attend school, as people did fifty years ago. But diligent school administrators have provided us the luxury of attending school in the comfort of our own homes. The structure of the traditional classroom is not the only one available to meet our needs. The people who were for years looked at sideways for being thirty and returning to school have now supplanted the focus of programs tailored around wants and academic needs. New departments have sprung up, or old ones have taken on a new mission. Currently, they include telling names, such as lifelong learning, adult learners, nontraditional students, distance programs, lifelong education, and many others. The educational institutions are changing with the times.As technology changes to help us, we will change to better help ourselves.

"Some people claim living in a rural area is better than living around a lot of people. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.

","People call the city or the small town home for a wealth of reasons, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Primarily, the small-town people espouse familiarity. In contrast, the city dwellers hide amidst the anonymity. These statements require further scrutiny.In a small town or in the country, the citizens become acquainted rather quickly. This acquaintance has several subtopics to it. First, families become friends for many generations, and that has a profound impact on lives. The families sometimes intermarry. Consequently, if people do relocate, often they later return to their original home, because both sets of parents live there. Next, land is often involved. Therefore, a kinship is made to the area and not only the people. It is difficult to walk away from an inheritance involving land.
